# golang-katas

I'm learning golang, and one of the best ways to learn a new language is to practice koans (challenging questions used for deeper reflection) or katas (formal sequence of choreographed moves for practice).

This repo hosts my attempts at completing the Golang [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/go?q=&beta=false&order_by=rank_id%20asc).
